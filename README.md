## Description

In the later semester of my second year in university, we were tasked with creating a bot that once placed on a 2D grid of cells, it will move around the cells and if the cell contains an object, spray it, and if it is a human, don't spray it.

During initation, the 2d grid of cells will randomly include a certain amount of objects to be sprayed, as well as humans which the bot should not spray at.

## Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/COVID-Cleaning-Spray-Bot.git
```

Open covid-spray-bot-main.ipynb in an IDE, run all, and then scroll down to the end of the notebook. Then set the iteration to 1, and then press visualise. After, a display full of cells should be shown to you, and the bot will then go around the cells to spray.
